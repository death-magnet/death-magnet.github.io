A little testing site for hosting my javascript implementation of a thing based on the rules of Conway's game of life.

The ultimate goal here is to create beautiful things that follow and morph according to the rules of the game of life. I like symmetrical patterns. I like geometric patterns. I like dynamic things. 

This is an attempt to do all of that...according to the rules of life.
